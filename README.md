# PauseMe
Good luck keeping me paused.

Just a simple demo, based on the default iOS Game Template (in Xcode 6.1.1). I loaded it up in Xcode Beta 6.2 and iOS 8.2 to see if it's still an issue.

## The issue
I can't keep the game paused.

Load it up. Pause and Unpause work (the button in the upper left corner).

However, pause the game. Exit the game (Home screen) and go back into the game, the scene says it's paused, but the sprites are still animated.
